## Model Description

- **Model**: (e.g., single-trait animal model, multi-trait GBLUP, spatial AR1xAR1)
- **Species/crop**: (e.g., dairy cattle, wheat, maize)
- **Data size**: (n observations, q animals/genotypes, t traits)

## Comparison Tool

- **Tool**: (ASReml-R, sommer, BLUPF90, Wombat, etc.)
- **Version**:

## Results Comparison

| Parameter | OpenBLUP | Reference Tool | Difference |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------|
| sigma2_a  |          |                |            |
| sigma2_e  |          |                |            |
| logL      |          |                |            |
| Top BLUP  |          |                |            |

## BLUP Correlation

Rank correlation between BLUPs from both tools:

## Data Availability

- [ ] I can share the dataset publicly
- [ ] I can share simulated data that reproduces the comparison
- [ ] Data is confidential but I've described the structure above

## Notes

Any observations about convergence speed, numerical differences, etc.
